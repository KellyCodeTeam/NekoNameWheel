        <h1>About Neko Name Wheel</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Neko Name Wheel, where a charming Japanese lucky cat brings fairness and fun to every decision! Neko (猫, meaning "cat" in Japanese) is inspired by the traditional Maneki-neko figurines you've seen in shop windows - those adorable beckoning cats believed to bring luck and prosperity.</p>
        
        <h2>Why We Created This</h2>
        <p>Random selection tools are everywhere, but most are... well, boring. We wanted to create something that makes the selection process itself an event worth celebrating. Whether you're a teacher picking students for presentations, a streamer choosing giveaway winners, or just deciding who pays for lunch, Neko adds charm and excitement to the moment.</p>
        
        <h2>What Makes Neko Special?</h2>
        <p>Our wheel of names uses cryptographically secure randomization - the same technology banks use for security. This means every spin is genuinely fair, with each name having exactly the same probability of being chosen. The winner is selected before the wheel even starts spinning, ensuring the animation perfectly aligns with the predetermined result.</p>
        
        <h2>Perfect For Everyone</h2>
        <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
            <li><strong>Teachers & Educators:</strong> Make classroom participation exciting! Students actually want to be picked when there's a spinning wheel and confetti involved.</li>
            <li><strong>Streamers & Content Creators:</strong> Turn routine giveaways into memorable moments. The wheel looks fantastic on camera and keeps viewers engaged.</li>
            <li><strong>Event Organizers:</strong> Run professional raffles and door prize drawings with complete transparency and visual appeal.</li>
            <li><strong>Teams & Groups:</strong> Make fair decisions for task assignments, turn order, or team formation without any bias.</li>
            <li><strong>Anyone Else:</strong> Sometimes you just need a fair way to decide something. Neko's got your back!</li>
        </ul>
