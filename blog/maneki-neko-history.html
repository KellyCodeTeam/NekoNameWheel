        <p>You've seen them everywhere - in Japanese restaurants, souvenir shops, and store windows. Those adorable ceramic cats with one paw raised in a beckoning gesture. But have you ever wondered about the story behind Maneki-neko (招き猫), and why they're believed to bring luck and prosperity?</p>

        <div class="ad-container">

        <h2>What Does "Maneki-neko" Mean?</h2>
        <p>The name "Maneki-neko" literally translates to "beckoning cat" or "inviting cat" in Japanese. The raised paw isn't waving goodbye - it's actually a welcoming gesture, inviting good fortune, customers, and prosperity to come inside!</p>

        <p>In Western culture, we beckon with our palm up, but traditional Japanese beckoning is done with the palm down, which is why Maneki-neko appear to be waving rather than beckoning to Western eyes.</p>

        <h2>The Legend of the Temple Cat</h2>
        
        <div class="legend-box">
            <p>The most popular origin story dates back to 17th century Japan, during the Edo period. A wealthy feudal lord was traveling when he was caught in a sudden rainstorm. Seeking shelter, he stopped under a tree near Gotoku-ji temple in Tokyo.</p>
            
            <p>As he stood there, the lord noticed a cat sitting at the temple's entrance, raising and lowering its paw as if beckoning to him. Curious, he approached the cat. The moment he stepped away from the tree, lightning struck it!</p>
            
            <p>The cat had saved his life. Grateful, the lord became the temple's patron, and when the cat died, the first Maneki-neko statue was created in its honor. The temple prospered, and the legend of the lucky cat spread throughout Japan.</p>
        </div>

        <p>To this day, Gotoku-ji temple in Tokyo is filled with hundreds of Maneki-neko figurines, left by visitors as offerings of gratitude for good fortune received.</p>

        <h2>What the Different Paws Mean</h2>
        <p>Not all Maneki-neko are the same! The raised paw actually has significance:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Left paw raised:</strong> Invites customers and people (popular with businesses)</li>
            <li><strong>Right paw raised:</strong> Invites wealth and good fortune (popular with individuals)</li>
            <li><strong>Both paws raised:</strong> Offers protection (though some consider this greedy!)</li>
            <li><strong>Paw height:</strong> The higher the paw, the greater distance the luck can travel from</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Meaning of Colors</h2>
        <p>Traditional Maneki-neko are white with colored accents, but modern versions come in many colors, each with special meaning:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>White (Traditional):</strong> Purity and positive energy</li>
            <li><strong>Black:</strong> Wards off evil spirits and stalkers</li>
            <li><strong>Gold:</strong> Attracts wealth and prosperity</li>
            <li><strong>Red:</strong> Protection from illness</li>
            <li><strong>Pink:</strong> Romance and love</li>
            <li><strong>Green:</strong> Academic success and health</li>
            <li><strong>Blue:</strong> Wisdom and intelligence</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="fact-box">
            <h3>Fun Fact!</h3>
            <p>The distinctive red collar and bell that Maneki-neko wear represent the collars that wealthy families in Edo-period Japan would put on their beloved pet cats. The bell helped locate the cat and showed that it was someone's treasured companion!</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Coin Connection</h2>
        <p>Many Maneki-neko hold a gold coin called a "koban" - an oval-shaped gold coin used during the Edo period. These coins were worth one ryō (a unit of currency), but Maneki-neko often hold coins inscribed with "千万両" (sen man ryō), meaning "ten million ryō" - a symbol of vast wealth!</p>

        <h2>From Temple to Pop Culture</h2>
        <p>What started as a temple tradition has become a global phenomenon. Maneki-neko appear in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Businesses worldwide (especially Asian restaurants and shops)</li>
            <li>Popular culture (Hello Kitty's design inspiration!)</li>
            <li>Video games and anime</li>
            <li>Modern art and design</li>
            <li>Digital spaces - like our own Neko Name Wheel!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Lucky Cat in Modern Japan</h2>
        <p>In contemporary Japan, you'll find Maneki-neko in countless locations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Store entrances welcoming customers</li>
            <li>Home entryways inviting prosperity</li>
            <li>Restaurant counters attracting business</li>
            <li>Taxi dashboards for safe travels and good fares</li>
            <li>Personal altars bringing household blessings</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Many Japanese people believe that placing a Maneki-neko facing the door brings the best luck, as it can invite positive energy and fortune into the space.</p>

        <h2>Scientific Skepticism Meets Cultural Charm</h2>
        <p>Of course, there's no scientific evidence that ceramic cats bring luck! But the Maneki-neko endures because it represents something deeper than superstition - it's a symbol of hope, optimism, and the welcoming spirit of Japanese hospitality (omotenashi).</p>

        <p>Whether you believe in its powers or simply appreciate its cultural significance and undeniable cuteness, the Maneki-neko reminds us to welcome opportunities with open paws and maintain a positive outlook.</p>

        <div class="cta-box">
